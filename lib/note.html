calling an instnace method on an instance of a class
  class SomeClass
    def some_instance_method
      some code
    end
  end

  an_instace = SomeClass.new()
  an_instace.some_instance_method


is different than whatever this is below(how we use to call methods in js w/out classes)...
class SomeClass
  def some_instance_method(some_param)
    some code with some_param
  end
end

an_instance = SomeClass.new()
some_instance_method("some argument")
